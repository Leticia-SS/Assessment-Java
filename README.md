# Assessment-Java

## Overview  
This project is a hands-on guide to Java development, structured into five key areas:  

1. **Environment Configuration**  
   - Setting up JDK and IntelliJ IDEA.  
   - Running and debugging basic programs.  

2. **Language Fundamentals**  
   - Logic building with conditionals and loops.  
   - User input validation and data processing.  

3. **Object-Oriented Programming**  
   - Designing classes, methods, and hierarchies.  
   - Encapsulation and polymorphism examples.  

4. **Advanced Topics**  
   - File I/O operations (reading/writing data).  
   - Basic data structures (arrays, string manipulation).  

5. **Mini-Projects**  
   - Interactive simulations (e.g., loan calculator, chat system).  
   - Integration of multiple concepts into cohesive programs.  

## Focus Areas  
- **Clean code practices** (readability, modularity).  
- **Problem decomposition** (breaking tasks into methods/classes).  
- **Debugging techniques** (IDE tools, error handling).  

Use this repository as a reference for building small-scale Java applications from scratch.
